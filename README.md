## About

Remember Dogecoin logo on Twitter / X ? So I clone https://github.com/cygaar/old-twitter Repo and changed a litlebit to make this Chrome extension that lets you shoe Dogecoin Logo.

The loading icon still needs to be replaced.

## Installation

Right now this extension is not uploaded to the Chrome web store. That may change later on.

In order to use this extension, you can load these files in as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
